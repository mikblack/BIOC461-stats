## BIOC461 - Statistics module

Statistics module for BIOC461 at the University of Otago.

Taught over two 2-3 hour sessions, in the Genetics computer lab, with students using either the lab computers, or their own laptops.

We seldom get through all of this material, so I pick and choose which bits to skip.  :)
